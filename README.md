# Distance Finger Calculator with OpenCV

This project calculates the distance between the **thumb** and **index finger** using **OpenCV**. It detects the positions of your fingers and computes the real-time distance between the thumb and index, making it ideal for applications like gesture-based controls or interactive applications.

## Features
- **Real-Time Finger Detection**: Detects the positions of the thumb and index finger using your camera.
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger in pixels.
- **Interactive**: Can be used for applications like controlling UI elements, gestures, or virtual interaction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe (for hand tracking)

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python finger_distance_calculator.py
   ```
2. Open the camera, and bring your thumb and index finger closer or further apart to see the distance in pixels.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork the project and contribute. Pull requests are always welcome!
